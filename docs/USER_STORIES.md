## Feature: [T4] File Access within Permissions (Filesystem Tools)

As a user, I want the agent restricted to a project subdirectory, so that it can't read or leak unrelated files on my machine.

Acceptance criteria:

- Path traversal outside the root (relative, absolute, symlink) is rejected.
- `AppConfig.tools.fs_allowed_root` defaults to `None`; fs tool is not registered when unset.

As a developer, I want the agent to list and read files in my project, so that it can answer questions grounded in my actual code.

Acceptance criteria:

- ReadFile/ListDir succeed for paths inside the allowed root.
- Nonexistent file returns a clean error string, no raw exception leak.
